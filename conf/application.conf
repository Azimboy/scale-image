## Secret key
# http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to sign Play's session cookie.
# This must be changed for production, but we don't recommend you change it in this file.

## Modules
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Modules
# ~~~~~
# Control which modules are loaded when Play starts.  Note that modules are
# the replacement for "GlobalSettings", which are deprecated in 2.5.x.
# Please see https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/GlobalSettings
# for more information.
#
# You can also extend Play functionality by using one of the publically available
# Play modules: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/ModuleDirectory
play.modules {
  # By default, Play will load any class called Module that is defined
  # in the root package (the "app" directory), or you can define them
  # explicitly below.
  # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
  #enabled += my.application.Module

  # If there are any built-in modules that you want to disable, you can list them here.
  #disabled += ""
}

## IDE
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/IDE
# ~~~~~
# Depending on your IDE, you can add a hyperlink for errors that will jump you
# directly to the code location in the IDE in dev mode. The following line makes
# use of the IntelliJ IDEA REST interface:
#play.editor="http://localhost:63342/api/file/?file=%s&line=%s"

## Internationalisation
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaI18N
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaI18N
# ~~~~~
# Play comes with its own i18n settings, which allow the user's preferred language
# to map through to internal messages, or allow the language to be stored in a cookie.
play.i18n {
  # The application languages
  langs = [ "en" ]

  # Whether the language cookie should be secure or not
  #langCookieSecure = true

  # Whether the HTTP only attribute of the cookie should be set to true
  #langCookieHttpOnly = true
}

## Filters
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaHttpFilters
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaHttpFilters
# ~~~~~
# Filters run code on every request. They can be used to perform
# common logic for all your actions, e.g. adding common headers.
#
#play.filters {

  # Enabled filters are run automatically against Play.
  # CSRFFilter, AllowedHostFilters, and SecurityHeadersFilters are enabled by default.
  # enabled += filters.ExampleFilter

  # Disabled filters remove elements from the enabled list.
  #disabled += filters.ExampleFilter
#}

## WS (HTTP Client)
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaWS#Configuring-WS
# ~~~~~
# The HTTP client primarily used for REST APIs.  The default client can be
# configured directly, but you can also create different client instances
# with customized settings. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += ws // or javaWs if using java
#
play.ws {
  # Sets HTTP requests not to follow 302 requests
  #followRedirects = false

  # Sets the maximum number of open HTTP connections for the client.
  #ahc.maxConnectionsTotal = 50

  ## WS SSL
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/WsSSL
  # ~~~~~
  ssl {
    # Configuring HTTPS with Play WS does not require programming.  You can
    # set up both trustManager and keyManager for mutual authentication, and
    # turn on JSSE debugging in development with a reload.
    #debug.handshake = true
    #trustManager = {
    #  stores = [
    #    { type = "JKS", path = "exampletrust.jks" }
    #  ]
    #}
  }
}

## Cache
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaCache
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaCache
# ~~~~~
# Play comes with an integrated cache API that can reduce the operational
# overhead of repeated requests. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += cache
#
play.cache {
  # If you want to bind several caches, you can bind the individually
  #bindCaches = ["db-cache", "user-cache", "session-cache"]
}

## Filters
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaHttpFilters
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaHttpFilters
# ~~~~~
# Filters run code on every request. They can be used to perform
# common logic for all your actions, e.g. adding common headers.
#
play.filters {

  # Enabled filters are run automatically against Play.
  # CSRFFilter, AllowedHostFilters, and SecurityHeadersFilters are enabled by default.
  enabled += filters.ExampleFilter

  # Disabled filters remove elements from the enabled list.
  disabled += play.filters.csrf.CSRFFilter
}

## Filter Configuration
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Filters
# ~~~~~
# There are a number of built-in filters that can be enabled and configured
# to give Play greater security.
#

play.filters {
  ## CORS filter configuration
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/CorsFilter
  # ~~~~~
  # CORS is a protocol that allows web applications to make requests from the browser
  # across different domains.
  # NOTE: You MUST apply the CORS configuration before the CSRF filter, as CSRF has
  # dependencies on CORS settings.
  cors {
    # Filter paths by a whitelist of path prefixes
    #pathPrefixes = ["/some/path", ...]

    # The allowed origins. If null, all origins are allowed.
    #allowedOrigins = ["http://www.example.com"]

    # The allowed HTTP methods. If null, all methods are allowed
    #allowedHttpMethods = ["GET", "POST"]
  }

  ## CSRF Filter
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaCsrf#Applying-a-global-CSRF-filter
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaCsrf#Applying-a-global-CSRF-filter
  # ~~~~~
  # Play supports multiple methods for verifying that a request is not a CSRF request.
  # The primary mechanism is a CSRF token. This token gets placed either in the query string
  # or body of every form submitted, and also gets placed in the users session.
  # Play then verifies that both tokens are present and match.
  csrf {
    # Sets the cookie to be sent only over HTTPS
    #cookie.secure = true

    # Defaults to CSRFErrorHandler in the root package.
    #errorHandler = MyCSRFErrorHandler
  }

  ## Security headers filter configuration
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/SecurityHeaders
  # ~~~~~
  # Defines security headers that prevent XSS attacks.
  # If enabled, then all options are set to the below configuration by default:
  headers {
    frameOptions = SAMEORIGIN
    xssProtection = null
    contentTypeOptions = null
    permittedCrossDomainPolicies = null
    contentSecurityPolicy = null
    # The X-Frame-Options header. If null, the header is not set.
    #frameOptions = "DENY"

    # The X-XSS-Protection header. If null, the header is not set.
    #xssProtection = "1; mode=block"

    # The X-Content-Type-Options header. If null, the header is not set.
    #contentTypeOptions = "nosniff"

    # The X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies header. If null, the header is not set.
    #permittedCrossDomainPolicies = "master-only"

    # The Content-Security-Policy header. If null, the header is not set.
    #contentSecurityPolicy = "default-src 'self'"
  }

  ## Allowed hosts filter configuration
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/AllowedHostsFilter
  # ~~~~~
  # Play provides a filter that lets you configure which hosts can access your application.
  # This is useful to prevent cache poisoning attacks.
  hosts {
    # Allow requests to example.com, its subdomains, and localhost:9000.
    #allowed = [".example.com", "localhost:9000"]
  }
}

play.assets {
  path = "/public"
  urlPrefix = "/assets"
}

application {
  temp-files-path = "temp"
}
